# AlphaFold-SFA

AlphaFold-SFA, a novel unsupervised learning approach combining AlphaFold, slow feature analysis (SFA), and metadynamics for enhanced sampling of rare events in proteins, such as cryptic pocket opening, protein-ligand binding, and allosteric communication. SFA, trained on small molecular dynamics simulations, efficiently captures these rare events, overcoming limitations of traditional simulations. The approach accelerates sampling of deep cryptic pockets and provides new insights into ligand binding/unbinding and allosteric communication, showcasing its potential in structure-based drug discovery.
